# Software Bug Prediction

Predicting software bugs before they occur can save time, money, and effort in the software development life cycle. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of bugs based on historical code and commit metrics.

## Problem Statement

Software bugs are costly and time-consuming. Early prediction of bugs can help in proactive debugging and testing. This project aims to use machine learning models to predict whether a piece of code or commit is likely to contain a bug based on historical features.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC
